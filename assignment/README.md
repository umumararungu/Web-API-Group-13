ALU Free Movie Hub
Overview
The ALU Free Movie Hub is a Python script that interfaces with two movie-related APIs to provide information about upcoming and popular movies. The script interacts with RapidAPI to fetch data from two endpoints, one for upcoming movies and another for popular movies.
Features
Upcoming Movies:
Fetches information about upcoming movies from the "moviesdatabase" API.
Displays the titles of upcoming movies.
Popular Movies:
Fetches information about popular movies from the "moviesminidatabase" API.
Displays the titles of the top 10 popular movies.
User Interaction:
Allows the user to choose between upcoming and popular movies.
Provides an option to exit the program
Functionality
Movie Categories:
The program allows users to choose between two movie categories: upcoming movies and popular movies.
API Integration:
Utilizes two movie-related APIs from RapidAPI to fetch data:
moviesdatabase API for upcoming movies.
moviesminidatabase API for popular movies.

Execution
The script is executed from the command line, and the user interacts with the program through the console.
Potential Enhancements
The prototype could be extended by adding more features, such as additional movie categories, more detailed movie information, or a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Code Organization
The code is well-organized and follows PEP 8 style conventions, making it clear and readable.
Limitations
The current prototype lacks comprehensive error handling and validation. Future iterations might consider more robust error handling, input validation, and edge case handling.
This prototype serves as a foundation for a simple movie information application, and further development can build upon this to create a more feature-rich and polished program.
